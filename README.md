### Since you are here, here is some random pieces of non useful advices for your life 👋

* error humanum est or if not you can always `"git commit --amend"`.
* Parenthesis are souls fulfilment, `M-x : (ielm)` is the answer to everything.
* shell automation is the real gift but have you ever mixed multi lines shell with python oneliner in a yaml field? 
* You say card castle, I heard cloud driven developement.
* hack it like no one's watching commit it like there's no tomorrow!
