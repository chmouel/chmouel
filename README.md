### Since you are here, here is some random pieces of non useful advices for your life ðŸ‘‹

* error humanum est or if not you can always `"git commit --amend"`.
* `M-x : (ielm)` and loose yourself between the 9 and 0.
* shell automation is the real gift but have you ever mixed multi lines shell with python oneliner in a yaml field? 
* You say card castle, I heard cloud driven developement.
* hack it like no one's watching commit it like there's no tomorrow!
